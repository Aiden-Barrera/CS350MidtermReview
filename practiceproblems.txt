Fill in the missing entries of the table. Set the word size, w, to be the smallest multiple of four bits large enough to hold the bit pattern.
w 	Binary 	Octal 	Decimal (signed) 	Decimal (unsigned) 	Hexadecimal
8 	10100010 				
		3151 			
			-1227 		
				26819 	
					A1A

Assuming w = 8, we can assign a numeric value to each possible hexadecimal number, assuming either an unsigned or a two's-complement interpretation. Fill in the following table according to these interpretations.
x 		
Hexadecimal 	Binary 	B2U8(x) 	B2T8(x)
0xEA 	________ 	________ 	________
0x01 	________ 	________ 	________
0x5B 	________ 	________ 	________
0x82 	________ 	________ 	________
0xD7 	________ 	________ 	________
0xFC 	________ 	________ 	________

Consider an array of two 16-bit signed integers stored in a big-endian, byte-addressable machine. The addresses and their corresponding byte values are given below.
Address 	Byte Value
0x104 	0xA3
0x103 	0xF9
0x102 	0x34
0x101 	0x12

 

    Determine the storage pattern of this array when it is stored in a little-endian machine.
    Calculate the decimal values of the two integers.
